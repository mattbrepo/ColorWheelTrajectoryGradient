# ColorWheelTrajectoryGradient
A study on the color wheel and the gradient derived by interpolating three colors

**Language: Javascript**

**Start: 2022**

## Why
A study on the color wheel done by using the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/). Three points are defined over the color wheel: the start, the middle and the end. Two gradient bars and related color trajectories are drawn by interpolating the three colors. The interpolation is performed by RGB and by Hue.

A HSV (hue, saturation, value = brightness) cylindrical representation of the color wheel:
